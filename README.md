# CodSoft Internship - Web Development
As part of the CodSoft Internship in Web Development, I worked on three projects aimed at enhancing my front-end development skills. The objective was to build responsive, user-friendly, and interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each project was designed to address specific web development challenges:

Landing Page Project – Creating an engaging and visually appealing landing page with smooth navigation and interactive elements.
Calculator – Developing a functional calculator with real-time arithmetic operations and a sleek UI.
Portfolio Website – Designing a personal portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and contact details in a professional manner.
These projects helped me strengthen my UI/UX design, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript logic implementation while following best coding practices.
